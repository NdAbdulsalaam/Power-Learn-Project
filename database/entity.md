1. **Attribute in the context of a database**:
   An attribute is a characteristic or property of an entity in a database. It represents a specific piece of information that describes the entity. For example, in a database of employees, attributes might include employee ID, name, address, salary, etc.

2. **Importance of having a unique identifier**:
   Having a unique identifier for each item in a database is important because it allows for efficient retrieval and manipulation of data. It ensures that each item can be uniquely identified and distinguished from others in the database, preventing ambiguity and ensuring data integrity. Unique identifiers serve as primary keys in database tables, enabling faster data retrieval and facilitating data relationships.

3. **Examples of attributes associated with a "Patient" entity**:

   - Name
   - Date of Birth
   - Gender
   - Blood Type

4. **Characteristics distinguishing library books**:
   - ISBN (International Standard Book Number)
   - Title

5. **Difference between single-valued attribute and multi-valued attribute**:
   - **Single-valued attribute**: A single-valued attribute is an attribute that can hold only a single value for each instance of an entity. For example, the "Age" attribute of a person entity is single-valued because each person has only one age. Another example could be the "Date of Birth" attribute.
   - **Multi-valued attribute**: A multi-valued attribute is an attribute that can hold multiple values for each instance of an entity. For example, the "Phone Number" attribute of a person entity can be multi-valued because a person may have multiple phone numbers. Another example could be the "Skills" attribute of an employee entity, as an employee may have multiple skills.
